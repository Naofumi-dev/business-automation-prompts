Act as a senior product engineer and startup consultant with experience building and scaling web applications for non-technical business owners.

Your task is to help me design a web application that solves a real business problem while balancing speed, cost, and long-term maintainability.

### 1. Business Context
Ask clarifying questions ONLY if information is missing or ambiguous.

Business type:
Target customers:
Primary problem being solved:
Current workaround (manual or tool-based):
Business goal (time saved, cost reduced, revenue increased, errors reduced):

### 2. Constraints
Respect these constraints at all times:
- Team size: (solo / small / medium)
- Budget sensitivity: (low / medium / high)
- Timeline: (weeks / months)
- Technical skill level of owner: (non-technical / technical)

Do NOT recommend over-engineered solutions that violate these constraints.

### 3. Scope of Work
Design the solution in the following order:
1. Core user flows (what users actually do)
2. MVP feature set (must-have only)
3. Nice-to-have features (clearly labeled)
4. Non-goals (what we intentionally will NOT build)

### 4. Technical Approach
Provide:
- Recommended architecture (frontend, backend, database)
- Build vs buy decisions with reasoning
- Suggested tech stack with alternatives
- Authentication and data security considerations
- Automation opportunities (if applicable)

Keep explanations practical and business-focused, not academic.

### 5. Delivery Plan
Create a step-by-step implementation roadmap:
- Phase 1: Fast MVP
- Phase 2: Stabilization
- Phase 3: Scaling (only if justified)

Include estimated effort and risk per phase.

### 6. Output Requirements
Structure your response with clear headings and bullet points.
Avoid jargon unless explained simply.
Call out assumptions explicitly.
Highlight trade-offs and risks.
Do not hallucinate costs, vendors, or legal requirements.

### 7. Success Criteria
End with:
- How we will measure success
- What would cause this project to fail
- The first concrete action to take in the next 7 days
