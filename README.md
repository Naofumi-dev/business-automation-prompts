# Business Automation Prompts

Practical prompt templates used to support the **design, scoping, and validation** of business automation and internal web applications.

The focus is not on generating code quickly, but on **clarifying business needs before building**.

---

## Purpose

Automation projects often fail due to:

- Unclear requirements  
- Vague business goals  
- Over-engineering too early  

These prompts are designed to help create clarity **before** implementation begins.

---

## What These Prompts Help With

- Defining the real business problem  
- Scoping an MVP correctly  
- Aligning technical decisions with business outcomes  
- Reducing friction during discovery and early planning  

---

## What’s Included

- Prompts for scoping automation projects  
- Templates for defining MVP features  
- Frameworks for internal tools and SaaS-style systems  
- Prompts for AI-assisted workflows where AI adds real value  

All prompts are structured to encourage:

- Clarity over speed  
- Simplicity over complexity  
- Business impact over technical novelty  

---

## How to Use

1. Select a prompt relevant to your use case  
2. Replace placeholders with your business context  
3. Run it using your preferred LLM  
4. Refine the output based on real constraints  

These prompts are most useful during:
- Discovery phases  
- Early design discussions  
- Pre-build validation  

---

## Who This Is For

- Business owners planning automation  
- Teams designing internal tools  
- Consultants and operators reducing discovery friction  
- Developers working closely with business stakeholders  

---

## Notes

These templates are shared as **general-purpose tools**.

They are not tied to any specific platform, framework, or vendor, and are intended to be adapted to fit different environments and constraints.

If a prompt helps clarify a real-world automation problem, it belongs here.
